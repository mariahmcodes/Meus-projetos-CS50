Question 1: How would you characterize their audio aura?

Based on the top 100 songs, the user’s audio aura can be described as follows:
+-------------+--------------+-------------------+
| AVG(energy) | AVG(valence) | AVG(danceability) |
+-------------+--------------+-------------------+
| 0.65906     | 0.484443     | 0.71646           |
+-------------+--------------+-------------------+

which suggests a mix of both happy(energy/danceability) and introspective(valence) moods.
Overall, their music preferences show a lively, rhythmic style, but not exclusively cheerful.

Question 2: Why might this calculation not be very representative, and how could it be improved?

The current calculation uses a simple average of the top 100 songs’ attributes,
which means all songs are weighted equally, regardless of how often each song was actually listened to.
This may not accurately reflect the user’s true listening habits, as favorite songs might have more impact than rarely played ones.
A better approach would be to weight each song by its play count when calculating the averages of energy, valence, and danceability,
producing a more representative audio aura.
